Sir, Let me explain that for you: 

 Ben Tennyson is the main protagonist of the *Ben 10* franchise. He's a boy who discovers an alien device called the Omnitrix. This watch-like device allows him to transform into various alien creatures, each with their own unique powers and abilities.  He uses these powers to fight evil, protect Earth, and go on various intergalactic adventures.  Initially a child having summer vacation with his Grandpa Max and cousin Gwen, Ben matures throughout the series, learning to be a responsible hero.
