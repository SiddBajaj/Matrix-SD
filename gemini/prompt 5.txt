Sir, Here's what I can tell you: 

 Ben Tennyson is the main protagonist of the *Ben 10* franchise. He's a boy who discovers the Omnitrix, a powerful alien watch-like device that allows him to transform into various alien creatures, each with unique powers and abilities. He uses these powers to fight evil, protect Earth, and generally have exciting adventures.  He starts off as a ten-year-old on summer vacation with his Grandpa Max and cousin Gwen, but the series follows him as he grows up, faces new challenges, and learns to be a hero.
