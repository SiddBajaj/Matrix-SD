Sir, Here's what I can tell you: 

 To give you the best answer, I need a little more information! "Who is..." is the start of a question, but I need the rest of the question to understand what you're asking.

For example, you could be asking:

*   **Who is the president of the United States?**
*   **Who is your favorite author?**
*   **Who is that actor in the movie?**
*   **Who is credited with inventing the lightbulb?**

Please provide the full question, and I'll do my best to give you a helpful answer..
